# 🐍Snake-Game-JavaScript-Grid-Based-Game
A classic Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The game runs on a dynamic grid system with real-time movement, score tracking, high-score persistence, and a timer feature.

# 📌 Project Overview

This Snake Game is a browser-based implementation of the traditional arcade game.
The snake moves within a dynamically generated grid, consumes food, increases in length, and updates the score accordingly. The game tracks time and stores the highest score using browser localStorage.

The project focuses on clean structure, modular logic, and responsive UI design.
